Locating taxi ranks can be challenging for customers, especially in unfamiliar areas or during peak hours, showing inefficiency. Moreover, difficulty in finding taxis leads to customer frustration, missed appointments, and potentially, reduced usage of taxi services.

### Business benefits
For Taxi Riders:
- Convenience: Riders can easily locate the nearest taxi rank, reducing waiting times and increasing travel convenience
- Time and Cost Savings: Fewer delays lead to savings in time and money 
- Improved Safety: Knowing the exact location of taxi ranks enhances rider safety

For Taxi Companies:
- Increased Customer Base: The website will attract new customers to the taxi industry, increasing potential revenue streams
- Reduced Empty Cruising: Improved visibility of taxi ranks can reduce empty cruising, saving fuel and reducing emissions
  
### Options Considered
- Other modes of transportation e.g. buses, trains, cars, or walking
- Uber
- SWOOP (Taxi app used in Southwest England)

### Expected Risks
