# Deployment

## Release Notes
The current version of our taxi rank finder website is version 1.0.0. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Mapbox GL JS library for mapping functionality. It relies on the user's browser supporting geolocation for optimal performance. 


Some known issues include that it only displays taxi ranks in central Bristol, so it may not be as useful to users far from the Bristol city centre. Moreover, there may be occasional inaccuracies in taxi rank data due to external data sources.


The UML Deployment diagram below illustrates the deployment of software components to hardware nodes. The taxi rank finder website displays a dependency on Bristol Open Data.
